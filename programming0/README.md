Programming 0
==========

[Programming 0](http://prog0.ist.tugraz.at/) offered an obligatory
assignment that allowed you to prove that you have programmed before
and don't need to be introduced to the basic concepts.

The task for this assignment was to read in a file consisting of seperated
text messages, merge them back together and write them into another file.
We also had to check if the files md5 sum is equal to one given in another 
file and then create a stats file (statistik.txt).
