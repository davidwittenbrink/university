A2 by Amel Hamidovic and David Wittenbrink
==========

a.)
The assignment was to implement a sorted linked list datastructure in C.
Our job was it to write the functions `sorted_list_create`, `sorted_list_add`,
`sorted_list_destroy` and `sorted_list_remove`.

b.)
Task b was to play around with function pointers. We were asked to implement the
`for_all` and `is_any` functions.
